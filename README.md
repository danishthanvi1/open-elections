open-elections
==============

All data. For all elections. On Github.

Goals:
* All data. On all elections. On github.
* Organically develop standard taxonomy and formats for election data

Roadmap:
Phase 1
* Collect existing data already on github or easily available: Afghanistan, Egypt, Tunisia, and Lebanon
* Create light set of github pages:
     * Organize the existing data
     * Describing the project goals and how to contribute
     * Instructions and recommended formats
     * Gravatars of contributors
* Determine and document project governance - how to handle pull requests, resolve disputes, whether/when to spin off as project

Phase 2
* Put out the call on Twitter and through networks for others to contrib. Help people not on github to get set up.
* Research other open data sets that can be liberated/added.

Phase 3
* As open data products and portals launch (Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Tunisia) use the opportunity to discuss the importance of open data and reference the project
* Convene conversation on data taxonomy and format standards
* Evolve and grow the gh-pages as needed
* Evolve governance structure as needed
